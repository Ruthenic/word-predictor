Please note that I never say this will generate sentences, only words.

# Instruction
first have a dataset of text named training-dataset.txt
presumably pretty large
then run `train.py` to create word/previous word pairs
then run `counter.py` to count the appearences of those seperate pairs
then run `produce.py` to actually generate something
then open `result.txt` to see your text
